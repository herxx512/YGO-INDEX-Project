# What is YGO INDEX?
YGO INDEX is an informational website about the anime series known as Yu-Gi-Oh!. The website contains images and information about each sequel/generation of Yugioh!. It also gives a brief description about the plots and the main characters. In addition, there is a webpage where users can search up cards from the anime. This includes all types of cards such as Monsters, Spells, and Trap cards. When viewing the card, users can decide to add it to their own deck in the "My Deck" section. If users wants to remove a specific card from their deck, they can by clicking on the "Remove" button underneath the specific card. In other words, YGO INDEX is an informational and deck building website for everyone (fans of Yu-Gi-Oh! and anyone who is new to this series).
