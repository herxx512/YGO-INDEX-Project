One day, he solves an ancient puzzle known as the Millennium Puzzle, causing his body to play host to a mysterious spirit with the personality of a gambler. From that moment onwards, whenever Yugi or one of his friends is threatened by those with darkness in their hearts, this other Yugi shows himself and challenges them to dangerous Shadow Games which reveal the true nature of someone's heart, the losers of these contests often being subjected to a dark punishment called a Penalty Game. Whether it be cards, dice, or role-playing board games, he will take on challenges from anyone, anywhere.(More information about the first adaptation:<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yu-Gi-Oh!_(1998_TV_series)" class="reference">HERE</a> and second adaptation:<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yu-Gi-Oh!_Duel_Monsters" class="reference">HERE</a>)</p>
